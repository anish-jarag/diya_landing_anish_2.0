      DIYA A.IND started as a father-daughter conversation about why students struggle with competitive exams. That
      spark became a movement to bring reasoning and understanding back into everyday learning.

  <Content title="Who We Are">
    <Fragment slot="content">
      <p>
        DIYA A.IND began with a quiet dinner-table observation between a doctor and his inquisitive daughter. They saw
        that many students worked hard yet relied on memorization rather than truly understanding concepts. Competitive
        exams demand logical reasoning, so DIYA was created to help students think for themselves.

      <p>
        DIYA exists not to replace schools or teachers, but to amplify understanding from within the existing system.
